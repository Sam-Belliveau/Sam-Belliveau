# Hi there, my name is Sam Belliveau

## Robotics

I was the President of Software Engineering for the Stuyvesant Robotics Team. Examples of my work can be seen in projects such as [StuyLib](https://github.com/StuyPulse/StuyLib), or [Edwin](https://github.com/StuyPulse/Edwin). I am the inital creator of StuyLib and have contributed the vast majority of the code and documentation. For Edwin I am resposible for restructuring all of the robot code, and cleaning up the subsystems to perform correctly. Much of my other work for the robotics team has been with regards to research, which is not visible on github.

## Personal Projects

A lot of my work has gone into libraries or random utilities for C++, many of which are on [my gist](https://gist.github.com/Sam-Belliveau). I have extensive experience with esoteric aspects of C++ such as SFINAE or template meta-programming. 

I like to make my projects very low level, and I don't make many webapps, or user interfaces at all for that matter. Most of my code would be what you would consider backend code, or even library code for some of my C++ projects. So if you would like to test out many of my projects you may need to know a decent amount of C++ to begin with.
