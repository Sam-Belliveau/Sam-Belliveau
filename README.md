# Hi there, my name is Sam Belliveau

## Robotics

I was the President of Software Engineering for the Stuyvesant Robotics Team. I've put a ton of work into projects such as StuyLib, or Edwin. 

## Personal Projects

A lot of my work has gone into libraries or random utilities for C++. Many of which are on [my gist](gist.github.com/Sam-Belliveau). I have extensive experience with esoteric aspects of C++ such as SFINAE or template meta-programming.
